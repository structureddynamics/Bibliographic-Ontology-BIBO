<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Bibliographic Ontology describes bibliographic things on the semantic Web in RDF.  This ontology can be used as a citation ontology, as a document classification ontology, or simply as a way to describe any kind of document in RDF. It has been inspired by many existing document description metadata formats, and can be used as a common ground for converting other bibliographic data sources.</span>
